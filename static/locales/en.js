    secondParagraph:
      'Cycling was an activity that I discovered shortly before the pandemic when I bought my bike initially to get around my neighborhood (to go to the soccer game, to the market, etc.) and little by little I began to enjoy it. During the pandemic, cycling became my main activity, riding for longer and longer distances.',
    thirdParagraph:
      'One of the most remarkable moments I have in my life as a child is when my father taught me for the first time to play chess, I think I was about 6 years old or less. I loved the movement of the pieces and the "shepherd\'s mate" strategy that I always wanted to do to my school friends during chess class. After that this activity was left aside in my life until I discovered Lichess (you can add me there) and how I could give the "shepherd\'s mate" only this time to another person on the other side of the world, of course it didn\'t work out and since then I have been watching and studying new moves to improve them.',
    fourthParagraph:
      "When I arrived in Brazil I discovered that Brazilians have other passions besides soccer and auto racing is one of them. I just didn't know what fun it was to watch 20 cars racing for an hour, until one day in 2018 I was unwittingly waiting for a TV program that would only start at the end of the Formula 1 race. I don't remember what exactly the race was, my only memory was seeing a dispute between a gray car (Mercedes) and two Ferrari cars vying for position at high speed on an S-shaped curve (search the internet for Hamilton and Vettel monza 2018). Since then I have not missed any Formula 1 GP.",
    fifthParagraph:
      'These are the main activities present in my life in the last 4 years besides reading, writing and watching movies/series.'
